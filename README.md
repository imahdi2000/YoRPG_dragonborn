ISH - I added Graphics to make it MORE AWESOME!!!
    : I found ASCII art online that I used to add the graphics, I had to modfify almost all of them becuase java wouldn't accept certain characters like semicolons, or backslashes in strings. In addtion, I had to seperate it line by line becuase I got an error "illegal start of expression" whenever I did that.
    - I also added a stats bar, (creds to Micheal for the idea), to update the user on their health and defense so they can make well informed decisions. I added it to the while loops becuase that's when the gameplay occured.
    - I also noticed that the pat.getname was giving us a default name instead of the characters actual name so I simply replaced pat.getname() with the variable name that the user gives us. 
    - I do not think the user needs to do anything different due to my changes.
